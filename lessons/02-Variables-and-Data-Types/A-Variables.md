**Lesson 2: Variables and Data Types**

**1. Introduction to Variables**

   Variables in programming are like containers that store data. They allow us to manipulate and work with information. In JavaScript, variables can store various types of data, including numbers, strings, and booleans.

   ```javascript
   // Example of declaring a variable and assigning a value
   let age = 25;
   let name = "John";
   let isStudent = true;
   ```

**2. Declaring Variables**

   In JavaScript, there are three ways to declare variables: `var`, `let`, and `const`. They differ in terms of scope and hoisting.

   ```javascript
   var x = 10; // Function-scoped variable
   let y = 20; // Block-scoped variable
   const z = 30; // Block-scoped constant
   ```

**3. Primitive Data Types**

   JavaScript has several primitive data types:

   - **Numbers:** Used for numeric values.

     ```javascript
     let age = 25;
     let price = 19.99;
     ```

   - **Strings:** Used for text data.

     ```javascript
     let name = "Alice";
     let greeting = 'Hello, World!';
     ```

   - **Booleans:** Used for true or false values.

     ```javascript
     let isStudent = true;
     let isLoggedIn = false;
     ```

**4. Working with Variables and Data Types**

   Now, let's explore how to work with variables and data types:

   - **Math Operations:**

     ```javascript
     let x = 10;
     let y = 5;
     let sum = x + y; // sum is 15
     let difference = x - y; // difference is 5
     ```

   - **String Concatenation:**

     ```javascript
     let firstName = "John";
     let lastName = "Doe";
     let fullName = firstName + " " + lastName; // fullName is "John Doe"
     ```

   - **Boolean Logic:**

     ```javascript
     let isTall = true;
     let isStrong = false;
     let isTallAndStrong = isTall && isStrong; // isTallAndStrong is false
     ```

**5. Practice and Exercises**

   Here are some exercises to practice the concepts:

   - Declare a variable for your age and print it to the console.
   - Create a variable for your favorite color and display it.
   - Calculate the area of a rectangle with given width and height.
   - Check if a user is eligible to vote based on their age.

**6. Conclusion**

   In this lesson, you've learned the basics of variables and data types in JavaScript. Understanding how to declare variables and work with different data types is fundamental in programming. In the next lesson, we'll dive deeper into variable scope and more advanced data structures.
