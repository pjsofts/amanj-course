**Exercise 1: Basic Math Operations**

Create an HTML file that includes JavaScript code to perform basic math operations and display the results in the console. Include addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. For example:

```javascript
console.log(5 + 3); // Addition
console.log(10 - 2); // Subtraction
console.log(4 * 6); // Multiplication
console.log(20 / 4); // Division
```

**Exercise 2: Variables and Output**

- Declare a variable called `name` and assign your name to it.
- Declare a variable called `age` and assign your age to it.
- Use `console.log()` to display a message in the console, including the variables you declared. For example:

```javascript
let name = "John";
let age = 30;
console.log("My name is " + name + " and I am " + age + " years old.");
```
