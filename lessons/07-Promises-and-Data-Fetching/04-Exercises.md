title: "Promises and Data Fretching Exercises"
---

**Exercise 1:** Fetch Data from an API
   - Write JavaScript code to fetch data from a public API (e.g., JSONPlaceholder or OpenWeatherMap) and log the response to the console.

**Exercise 2:** Handle Errors
   - Modify the code from Exercise 1 to handle errors gracefully using `.catch()` and display an error message if the API request fails.

**Exercise 3:** Chaining Promises
   - Fetch data from two different endpoints using Promises and log the combined result to the console.

**Exercise 4:** Promise.all
   - Create an array of API requests and use `Promise.all` to fetch data from multiple endpoints simultaneously. Log the results to the console when all requests are complete.

**Exercise 5:** Async/Await
   - Rewrite one of the previous exercises using the `async/await` syntax to fetch and display data.

**Exercise 6:** Error Handling with Async/Await
   - Modify the code from Exercise 5 to handle errors using `try/catch` and display an error message if any API request fails.

**Exercise 7:** Fetch and Render
   - Create a simple HTML page with a button. When the button is clicked, fetch data from an API and render it on the page.

**Exercise 8:** Loading Indicator
   - Enhance the code from Exercise 7 by displaying a loading indicator (e.g., a spinner) while the data is being fetched and hiding it once the data is loaded.

**Exercise 9:** Pagination
   - Implement pagination for a list of items fetched from an API. Allow users to click "Next" and "Previous" buttons to load more data.

**Exercise 10:** Data Post Processing
   - Fetch data from an API and manipulate it in some way (e.g., filter, sort, or transform). Display the processed data on the webpage.
