```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>

<head>
    <title>Your Page Title</title>
</head>

<body>

    <h1>This is a Heading</h1>
    <p>This is a paragraph.</p>

</body>

</html>
```

Let me break it down for you:

- `<!DOCTYPE html>`: This declaration defines the document type and version of HTML. It should be placed at the very beginning of your HTML document.

- `<html>`: This is the root element of an HTML page.

- `<head>`: Contains meta-information about the HTML document, such as the title (which appears on the browser tab).

- `<title>`: Sets the title of the HTML document. This is what appears on the browser tab.

- `<body>`: Contains the content of your HTML page, such as text, images, links, etc.

- `<h1>` to `<h6>`: These are heading tags. `<h1>` is the largest and `<h6>` is the smallest. They define headings and subheadings.

- `<p>`: Stands for "paragraph." It defines a paragraph of text.
