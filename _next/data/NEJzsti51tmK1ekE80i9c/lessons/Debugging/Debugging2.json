Conditional Breakpoints\n\nConditional breakpoints allow you to pause code execution only when a specified condition is met. This is incredibly useful for debugging loops or specific scenarios. Here's how to set a conditional breakpoint in most browser developer tools:\n\n1. Open your browser's developer tools (usually by pressing `F12` or `Ctrl + Shift + I` on Windows/Linux or `Cmd + Option + I` on macOS).\n\n2. Navigate to the \"Sources\" or \"Debugger\" tab.\n\n3. Find the line where you want to set the breakpoint.\n\n4. Right-click on the line number and select \"Add conditional breakpoint.\"\n\n5. Enter your condition. For example, you can pause when a variable reaches a certain value.\n\n#### 2. Call Stack and Call Stack Navigation\n\nUnderstanding the call stack is crucial for debugging. The call stack is a data structure that keeps track of function calls in your code. When an error occurs, the call stack can help you trace the sequence of function calls that led to the error.\n\nMost developer tools provide a call stack panel that shows the current call stack. You can click on a function in the stack to navigate to the code where it was called. This is particularly useful for finding the origin of an error.\n\n#### 3. Watch Expressions\n\nWatch expressions allow you to monitor the value of variables or expressions as you step through your code. This can be extremely helpful for tracking changes in variables during debugging. In many debugging environments, you can add watch expressions by entering the variable or expression in the watch panel.\n\n#### 4. Profiling\n\nProfiling is the process of analyzing your code's performance to identify bottlenecks and areas for optimization. Most developer tools include a profiler that can help you measure CPU and memory usage, track function execution times, and pinpoint performance issues.\n\n#### 5.

Developer tools usually have a network panel that displays all network activity, including requests, responses, and their timing.
